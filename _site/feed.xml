<p>I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something ‘bout it felt like home somehow
And I, left my scarf there, at your sister’s house
And you’ve still got it in your drawer, even now</p>

<p>Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We’re singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days</p>

<p>And I know it’s long gone
And that magic’s not here no more
And I might be okay
But I’m not fine at all</p>

<p>‘Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red ‘cause you were lookin’ over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well</p>

<p>Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin sized bed
And your mother’s telling stories ‘bout you on the Tee-ball team
You taught me ‘bout your past, thinking your future was me</p>

<p>And I know it’s long gone
And there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to</p>

<p>‘Cause there we are again, in the middle of the night
We’re dancing ‘round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well</p>

<p>And maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece ‘til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well</p>

<p>And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I’m a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
‘Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well</p>

<p>Time won’t fly, it’s like I’m paralysed by it
I’d like to be my old self again
But I’m still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone</p>

<p>But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
‘Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can’t get rid of it
‘Cause you remember it all too well</p>

<p>‘Cause there we are again, when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you’ve ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well</p>

<p>Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well</p>]]></content><author><name>jekyll update</name></author><category term="jekyll" /><category term="update" /><category term="speeches" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Maps - Maroon 5</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2023/03/02/maps.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Maps - Maroon 5" /><published>2023-03-02T00:00:00-03:00</published><updated>2023-03-02T00:00:00-03:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2023/03/02/maps</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2023/03/02/maps.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/pt/2/26/Capa_de_Maps.jpg" alt="Maps - Maroon 5" /></p>

<p>I miss the taste of a sweeter life
I miss the conversation
I’m searching for a song tonight
I’m changing all of the stations</p>

<p>I like to think that we had it all
We drew a map to a better place
But on that road I took a fall
Oh, baby, why did you run away?</p>

<p>I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest nights</p>

<p>But I wonder, where were you?
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder, where were you?
All the roads you took came back to me
So I’m following the map that leads to you</p>

<p>The map that leads to you
Ain’t nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you</p>

<p>The map that leads to you
Ain’t nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following</p>

<p>I hear your voice in my sleep at night
Hard to resist temptation
‘Cause something strange has come over me
And now I can’t get over you
No, I just can’t get over you, oh</p>

<p>I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest nights</p>

<p>But I wonder, where were you?
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder, where were you?
All the roads you took came back to me
So I’m following the map that leads to you</p>

<p>The map that leads to you
Ain’t nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain’t nothing I can do
The map that leads to you</p>

<p>Oh, oh, oh, ah
Ooh, oh, oh, ah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ah
Ah, ah, mmm, ah</p>

<p>Oh, I was there for you
Oh, in you darkest time
Oh, I was there for you
Oh, in your darkest night</p>

<p>Oh, I was there for you
Oh, in you darkest time
Oh, I was there for you
Oh, in your darkest night</p>

<p>But I wonder, where were you?
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder, where were you?
All the roads you took came back to me
So I’m following the map that leads to you</p>

<p>The map that leads to you
Ain’t nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you</p>

<p>The map that leads to you
Ain’t nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following</p>]]></content><author><name>jekyll update</name></author><category term="jekyll" /><category term="update" /><category term="speeches" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Payphone - Maroon 5</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2023/03/02/payphone.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Payphone - Maroon 5" /><published>2023-03-02T00:00:00-03:00</published><updated>2023-03-02T00:00:00-03:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2023/03/02/payphone</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2023/03/02/payphone.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://akamai.sscdn.co/uploadfile/letras/albuns/3/b/7/1/26148.jpg" alt="Payphone - Maroon 5" /></p>

<p>I’m at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it’s all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?</p>

<p>Yeah, I, I know it’s hard to remember
The people we used to be
It’s even harder to picture
That you’re not here next to me
You say it’s too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in or time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down</p>

<p>I’ve wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I’m paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the Sun sets in paradise</p>

<p>I’m at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it’s all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?</p>

<p>If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I’ll be sick
Oh</p>

<p>You turned your back on tomorrow
‘Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away
You can’t expect me to be fine
I don’t expect you to care
I know I’ve said it before
But all of our bridges burned down</p>

<p>I’ve wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I’m paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the Sun sets in paradise</p>

<p>I’m at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it’s all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?</p>

<p>If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I’ll be sick
Now I’m at a payphone</p>

<p>Man, fuck that shit
I’ll be out spending all this money while you sitting round
Wondering why it wasn’t you who came up from nothing
Made it from the bottom
Now when you see me I’m stunning
And all of my cars start with a push of a button
Telling me the chances I blew up
Or whatever you call it
Switch the number to my phone
So you never could call it
Don’t need my name on my show
You can tell it I’m ballin’</p>

<p>Swish, what a shame, could have got picked
Had a really good game, but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could have saw
But, sad to say, it’s over for
Phantom pulled valet open doors
Wiz, like go away got what you was looking for
Now it’s me who they want
So you can go and take that little piece of shit with you</p>

<p>I’m at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it’s all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?</p>

<p>If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I’ll be sick
Now I’m at a payphone</p>]]></content><author><name>jekyll update</name></author><category term="jekyll" /><category term="update" /><category term="speeches" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Red - Taylor Swift</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2023/03/02/red.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Red - Taylor Swift" /><published>2023-03-02T00:00:00-03:00</published><updated>2023-03-02T00:00:00-03:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2023/03/02/red</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2023/03/02/red.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/pt/8/8b/Capa_de_Red_por_Taylor_Swift.jpg" alt="Red - Taylor Swift" /></p>

<p>Loving him is like driving a new Maserati
Down a dead end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin
Ending so suddenly</p>

<p>Loving him is like trying to change your mind
Once you’re already flying through the free fall
Like the colours in autumn, so bright
Just before they lose it all</p>

<p>Losing him was blue, like I’d never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red (red, red, red, red)
Loving him was red (red, red, red, red)</p>

<p>Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted
Was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words
To your old favorite song</p>

<p>Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword
And realizing there’s no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you’d never found out
That love could be that strong</p>

<p>Losing him was blue, like I’d never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red (red, red)
Oh, red (red, red)
Burning red (red, red, red, red)</p>

<p>Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it’s time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red</p>

<p>Burning, it was red</p>

<p>Oh, losing him was blue, like I’d never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
‘Cause loving him was red (red, red)
Yeah, yeah, red (red, red)
Oh, burning red (red, red, red, red)</p>

<p>And that’s why he’s spinning ‘round in my head
Comes back to me burning red (red, red)
Yeah, yeah (red, red)</p>

<p>His love was like driving a new Maserati
Down a dead end street</p>]]></content><author><name>jekyll update</name></author><category term="jekyll" /><category term="update" /><category term="speeches" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry></feed>
