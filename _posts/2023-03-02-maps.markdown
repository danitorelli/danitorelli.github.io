I miss the taste of a sweeter life
I miss the conversation
I'm searching for a song tonight
I'm changing all of the stations

I like to think that we had it all
We drew a map to a better place
But on that road I took a fall
Oh, baby, why did you run away?

I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest nights

But I wonder, where were you?
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder, where were you?
All the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you

The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you

The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following

I hear your voice in my sleep at night
Hard to resist temptation
'Cause something strange has come over me
And now I can’t get over you
No, I just can’t get over you, oh

I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest nights

But I wonder, where were you?
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder, where were you?
All the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you

The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you

Oh, oh, oh, ah
Ooh, oh, oh, ah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ah
Ah, ah, mmm, ah

Oh, I was there for you
Oh, in you darkest time
Oh, I was there for you
Oh, in your darkest night

Oh, I was there for you
Oh, in you darkest time
Oh, I was there for you
Oh, in your darkest night

But I wonder, where were you?
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder, where were you?
All the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you

The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you

The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following
